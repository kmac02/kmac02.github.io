    <p>This page is about the books that are spilling out of the shelves and taking over my home. Not quite <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/theres-a-japanese-word-for-people-who-buy-more-books-than-they-can-actually-read_us_58f79b7ae4b029063d364226"><em>tsundoku</em></a> but close.</p>

      <p>I'm a fan of Science Fiction and Fantasy and one of my favorite (non-publisher) blogs is <a href="https://www.worldswithoutend.com/index.asp">Worlds Without End.</a> The site offers extensive lists including, but not limited to, book releases by year, book awards, and user/fan recommendations. There are book descriptions and reviews, but the site is best for users to track what the read and browse lists. (Similar to <a href="https//:goodreads.com">Goodreads</a> but just for SFF.) Sometimes the amount of content seems overwhelming, but I appreciate its dedication to lists over promotions or ratings.</p>
